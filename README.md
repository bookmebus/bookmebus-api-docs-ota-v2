# OTA API For developer

This docs will guide you through OTA API to create your own full featured transit application. The API is a REST with Oauth2 protocol.

You can try the live demo of the API here [https://www.bookmebus.info](https://www.bookmebus.info)

We provide full integration from development to production. Please contact your Transit Operator partner to get your connection credential for both staging and production.

There are 2 separated versions of the API.
  - api/v1: is the legacy Bus system and will be deprecated soon. We maintain it for compatibility purposes.
  - api/v2: is the full featured transit system ( bus, ferry, train...). It is our cutting edge transit that support complex scenario. This will benefit for both operator and API connector and it is the recommended version.
